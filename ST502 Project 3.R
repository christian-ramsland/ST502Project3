#Part 1: Comparing Two-Sample T-Tests

#Read in MPG data
mpgData <- read.csv("~/ST503/Code/mpg.txt", sep="")

#Create objects for US MPG and Japanese MPG
USmpg <- mpgData[1:249,1]
JapanMPG <- mpgData[250:328,1]

#Pooled Two-Sample T-Test
t.test(x=USmpg,y=JapanMPG,paired=FALSE,var.equal=TRUE)
print("The pooled t-test suggests there is evidence that there is a difference in MPG between US-made cars and Japanese-made cars.")

#Unequal Variances Two-Sample T-Test
t.test(x=USmpg,y=JapanMPG,paired=FALSE,var.equal=FALSE)
print("The unequal variances t-test suggests there is evidence that there is a difference in MPG between US-made cars and Japanese-made cars.")

#Plot densities for US MPG and Japanese MPG
plot(density(USmpg),xlab="MPG",main="MPG for US-Made Cars")
plot(density(JapanMPG),xlab="MPG",main="MPG for Japanese-Made Cars")
#Based on the density plots, the normality assumption is not well met for either sample.
#The US MPG data is right-skewed and multimodal.
#The Japanese MPG data is bimodal and slightly left-skewed.

#Which test is best?
#Perform an F-test to compare the two variances
var.test(x=USmpg,y=JapanMPG,alternative="two.sided")
#The F-Test suggests there is not a significant difference in variances.
#Comparison of results from the two types of t-tests:
 #same p-values and both tests rejected the null hypothesis
 #the CI for the unequal variances t-test was slightly smaller
#Based on the results from the F-test, I would use the pooled variances t-test
